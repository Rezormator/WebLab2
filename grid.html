        Off-Court Impact and Charitable Work
        Stephen Curry, beyond his basketball career, is a dedicated philanthropist. He and his wife Ayesha co-founded
        the Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation, which focuses on ending childhood hunger, promoting education, and encouraging
        active lifestyles. The foundation has provided millions of meals and supported youth development programs. Curry
        also backs initiatives like Nothing But Nets, which fights malaria in Africa, and advocates for racial equality
        and social justice.
        Curry's Christian faith and family are central to his life. He often attributes his success to his beliefs and
        is known for his pre-game ritual of pointing to the sky in gratitude. He shares a close bond with his wife
        Ayesha and their three children—Riley, Ryan, and Canon—and frequently shares family moments with fans.
        Despite multiple injuries, including early ankle surgeries, Curry has continued to perform at an elite level.
        His dedication to his fitness has enabled him to remain a top player in the league well into his 30s.
        Curry has helped globalize basketball, particularly in Asia, where his offseason tours have fueled the sport's
        popularity. His relatively smaller stature (6'2") and skill-based game have inspired young athletes worldwide.
        Curry’s legacy as one of the greatest shooters and transformative players in NBA history is secure, with his
        impact on modern basketball evident in the shift towards three-point shooting and spacing strategies. As he
        continues his career, his influence on future generations of players will only grow.
